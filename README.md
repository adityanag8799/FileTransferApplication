# FileTransferApplication

üöÄ launched my latest project: a robust and efficient file transfer application built from the ground up using Java and the power of multithreaded programming!

üìÇ File Transfer Simplified: With a seamless blend of client and server components, this application makes transferring files a breeze. Whether you're sharing documents, images, or media files, it's all about speed, security, and ease of use.

üîó Multithreaded Server: The heart of the application is a multithreaded server that can handle multiple client requests simultaneously. This means no more waiting in line ‚Äì our server works in parallel, ensuring quick and efficient file transfers.

üì° Highly Responsive: Network programming can be a challenge, but we've ensured that our application stays responsive even under heavy loads. Users can initiate transfers with confidence, knowing that their files will be swiftly and securely delivered.

üõ°Ô∏è Robust Security: Security is paramount when dealing with file transfers. Our application incorporates encryption and authentication measures to protect your data throughout the entire transmission process, guaranteeing peace of mind.

üåê Cross-Platform Compatibility: Whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux, our application supports cross-platform compatibility. It's designed to bring people closer through file sharing, no matter what operating system they're using.

üìä Real-time Progress Tracking: Want to keep an eye on your transfers? We've implemented real-time progress tracking, so you can monitor the status of your uploads and downloads at a glance.

üéØ User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to individuals of all technical backgrounds. No need for a computer science degree to use this application!

üöß Future-Ready: Our project is a foundation for future improvements. We're constantly working to enhance and expand its capabilities, ensuring that it remains a top-notch choice for file transfer needs.

üåü Ready to Connect: If you're interested in networking, Java, or file transfer applications, let's connect! I'm open to discussing the project in more detail, sharing insights, or exploring collaboration opportunities. Together, we can continue to make file sharing a seamless experience.


**Code Description:** 
**FTServer**

The provided Java code implements a simple file transfer server with a graphical user interface (GUI) for server control and logging. It is divided into several classes:

- `RequestProcessor`: This class represents a thread that handles incoming client requests. It reads header data, extracts file information, saves files, and communicates with clients.

- `FTServerF`: This class manages the server setup, listens for incoming client connections, and creates `RequestProcessor` threads for each connected client.

- `FTServerFrame`: This class represents the server's GUI, providing buttons to start and stop the server and a text area for logging server activities.

**How It Works:**

1. The `FTServerFrame` class creates a graphical user interface (GUI) with a "Start" button for server activation and a text area for logging server activities.

2. When the "Start" button is pressed, an instance of the `FTServerF` class is created, which sets up the server socket and starts listening for incoming connections on port 5500.

3. For each incoming client connection, a new `RequestProcessor` thread is created. This thread handles the following steps:
   - Reads the header data from the client, including the file name and length.
   - Extracts the file name and length from the header.
   - Notifies the server GUI about the incoming file.
   - Creates or overwrites the file in the "uploads" directory.
   - Sends an acknowledgment to the client.
   - Receives and saves the file data.
   - Sends another acknowledgment to the client.
   - Closes the connection with the client.
   - Notifies the server GUI about the file save and connection closure.

4. The server can be stopped by pressing the "Stop" button in the GUI, which shuts down the server socket and stops listening for new connections.

Overall, this code demonstrates a basic file transfer server that can receive files from multiple clients and log its activities in a graphical user interface. However, it is a simplified example and may require additional error handling and security measures for production use.


**Code Description** 
**FTClient**

This Java code represents a file upload application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting and uploading files to a server. It consists of various classes and components:

- **FileUploadEvent Class:** Represents events related to file uploads, storing uploader information and upload progress.

- **FileUploadListener Interface:** Defines methods for handling file upload status changes.

- **FileModel Class:** Extends `AbstractTableModel` to manage file data in a table, aiding file selection.

- **FTClientFrame Class:** Serves as the main client-side framework, featuring file selection and upload monitoring panels.

- **FileSelectionPanel Class:** Allows users to select files and displays them in a table with an "Add File" button.

- **FileUploadViewPanel Class:** Enables file upload initiation and progress monitoring for selected files.

- **ProgressPanel Class:** Nested within `FileUploadViewPanel`, displays the progress of individual file uploads.

- **FileUploadThread Class:** Manages file uploads in separate threads, handling socket connections and progress updates.

- **Main Method:** Initializes the client-side application.

In summary, this code provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and uploading files to a server, allowing users to monitor the progress of multiple file uploads simultaneously. It makes use of Java's Swing library for creating the graphical interface and multithreading to handle concurrent file uploads efficiently.
